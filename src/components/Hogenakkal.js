              Hogenakkal Tourism Hogenakkal is a waterfall located in Dharmapuri
              district of Tamil Nadu where the Kaveri river splits into multiple
              streams of waterfalls. Located at a distance of 180 km from
              Bangalore, Hogenakkal has water throughout the year. The carbonite
              rocks, the coracle (basket boat) rides, freshwater fish, oil
              massages by locals make it a perfect one day trip or a weekend
              getaway from Bangalore.

              Sometimes referred to as the "Niagara Falls of India," it is also
              known for the medicinal baths. Also known at Marikottayam, Hoge
              actually means smoke and Kal means rock. Recently, the place has
              been found to be littered with plastic bags and garbage and the
              fish market outside the waterfall might stink. Weekends can be
              crowded. Keep all these points in mind before visiting.
