              Hogenakkal Falls is a scintillating waterfall that is located on
              river Kaveri in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu. The place
              gets its name from Hogenakkal, which means 'smoking rocks', owing
              to the unique rock arrangement that exists around it. The gushing
              beauty of this cascade is one of a kind and is often quoted as
              being the "Niagara falls of India".
            </p>
            <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
              The Kaveri River forks into multiple streams and falls through

              the numerous herbs that grow in its path. Known for its pristine
