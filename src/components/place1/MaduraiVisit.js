                Monsoon season in Madurai lasts from June to August. Although
                the monsoon season continues for a smaller amount of time, the
                south-west monsoon winds bring in a large amount of rainfall
                which is extremely heavy. This rainfall also makes the weather
                gloomy but still makes the city beautiful as the nature around
                Madurai mainly benefits from this rain. This is the perfect time
                to visit Madurai for people who love greenery and the lush
                natural surroundings.

                The summer season in Madurai lasts from March to May. The
                temperatures during this season range from 24 degree Celsius to
                34 degree Celsius. This means that the weather in Madurai during
                these months is uncharacteristically hot. It is also really dry
                which makes the heat more noticeable and discourages travellers
                to visit. The summer season is, therefore, an offseason for
                Madurai, and the crowds are comparatively less as well.
