            October to June is the best time to visit Yercaud because the
            weather is dry and cool. However, Yercaud offers breathtaking views
            and a tranquil ambience throughout the year. During the month of
            May, a seven-day Summer Festival is conducted which includes flower
            shows, dog shows, boating races and village fairs. Monsoons (July-
            September) could be avoided as rains might hamper your sightseeing
            plans, but the rains make this place extra beautiful and you might
            not want to miss that either.
