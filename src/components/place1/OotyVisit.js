            The best time to visit Ooty is throughout the year as the weather is
            pleasant and great for sightseeing. The temperature usually ranges
            from 5-15 degrees throughout the year with colder nights. However,
            the peak season is from October to June when the weather is pleasant
            and you can get involved in outdoor activities. Ooty can be visited
            during monsoons (if you don't mind the rain) when the freshly washed
            surroundings give Ooty an ethereal charm. The annual Tea and Tourism
            Festival attracts crowds in huge numbers to visit the place and have
            a great time in this wonderful place.

            The poised and elegant 'Queen of Hill Stations' welcomes you to the
            kingdom in the clouds. Individuals travel far and wide to partake in
            the awe-inspiring wonders of one of India's most beloved hill
            stations - Ootacamund or Ooty. Here, history and culture form a
            sweet medley, while nature sings to its own symphony. Colonial
            churches, Hindu temples, tribal museums and libraries brand the
            plains with stories.

              Ooty are perfect to have a gala time. Each year, during January or
              February, Department of Tourism in Tamil Nadu hosts The Tea and
              Tourism Festival for three days. A vast range of tea leaves are
              displayed, and rows of tea stalls are put up for tasting and
              buying a wide variety of tea. In addition to this, these three
              days are packed with cultural shows and performances, which

              are unlikely to experience the bright, warm sunshine, you will
