              Madurai Tourism Madurai, the cultural capital of Tamil Nadu, is
              one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities of India. Ruled by
              Pandya kings for the longest time in its history, it is called as
              the 'Lotus City' as it was planned and built in the shape of a
              lotus. Madurai is known for Meenakshi Amman Temple, dedicated to
              the goddess Meenakshi with a sanctum for her consort,
              Sundareshwarar.

              Thiruparankundram. It is one of the important old temples
              dedicated to Lord Muruga(Karthikeya) and is located on a hillock
              approximately 8 km from the city. Having trade ties with ancient
              Rome, the place holds a great cultural heritage. With bustling
              bazaars and fantastic street food, Madurai has heritage walks
